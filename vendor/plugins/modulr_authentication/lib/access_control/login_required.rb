  # Filter method to enforce a login requirement.
  #
  # To require logins for all actions, use this in your controllers:
  #
  #   before_filter :login_required
  #
  # To require logins for specific actions, use this in your controllers:
  #
  #   before_filter :login_required, :only => [ :edit, :update ]
  #
  # To skip this in a subclassed controller:
  #
  #   skip_before_filter :login_required
