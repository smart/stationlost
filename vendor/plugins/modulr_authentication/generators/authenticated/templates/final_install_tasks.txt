You're almost finished!  Before your app and your tests will run, you must:

* In app/controllers/application.rb, somewhere *inside* the class (after the
  "class ApplicationController ..." line), add a line like
 
    security_components :security_policy, :access_control,
      :authentication => [:by_cookie_token, :by_password]

* in whichever are appropriate of spec/spec_helper.rb and test/test_helper.rb,
  add the line

  include AuthenticationTestHelper

* If you use stories, you have to have a root ('/') controller -- something to
  handle the redirect to home. You need this anyway for your site to do stuff,
  but the stories in particular will break without it.


* If you use a public repository for your code (such as github, rubyforge,
  gitorious, etc.) make sure to NOT post your site_keys.rb (add a line like
  '/config/initializers/site_keys.rb' to your .gitignore or do the svn ignore
  dance), but make sure you DO keep it backed up somewhere safe.

Finally: this is a new (beta) version of the plugin (5/2008). Much has changed.
If you're following along from a tutorial and you're sad and angry because
nothing makes sense, you may find contentment with the older version:
